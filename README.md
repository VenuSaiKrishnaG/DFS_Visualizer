# DFS_Visualizer

DFS stands for Depth First Search
The Depth First Search Algorithm a Graph traversal Technique.
This algorithm takes a root node(here it is last cell in maze).
I have visualized the depth first search to a maze problem.

#Procedure
It has a starting point at last row, last cell in maze .
From this point, we should move to ending point which is at first row, first cell in maze.
Here, through DFS we can move in 4 directions(North, South, East, West).
